			The History of PREDICT
			**********************

Work on PREDICT started on May 26, 1991 with the purpose of creating
a replacement for QUIKTRAK software that ran on the Commodore 64 home
computer.  PREDICT was originally written in C and compiled using a
"Super C" compiler.  After the program was completed and found to be
useful, PREDICT was then ported to several Unix machines and then to
DOS using a Borland Turbo C++ compiler.  The DOS version was completed
in May 1994 and was the first version of PREDICT released to the public.
PREDICT was later ported to the Linux operating system in 1995 and
released as freeware as a pre-compiled a.out dynamically linked
binary in 1996.

Through years of daily use by many users, PREDICT was found to be
reliable, accurate, and easy to use.  Only minor changes were made
to the program until 1999 when major portions were re-written from
scratch and many new features were added.

PREDICT Version 2 for DOS represents the second major release of the
program, and is designed to serve as a replacement for the original
DOS version of PREDICT released in 1994.  Although similar to the Linux
version of the program, the DOS version of PREDICT does not include
all the features of the Linux version.
