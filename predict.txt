LICENSING
       PREDICT  is  an easy-to-use satellite tracking and orbital
       prediction program written and created by John A.  Maglia-
       cane, KD2BD.

       PREDICT  is  free software. You can redistribute it and/or
       modify it under  the  terms  of  the  GNU  General  Public
       License  as  published  by  the  Free Software Foundation,
       either version 2 of the License or any later version.

       PREDICT is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,

DESCRIPTION
       The DOS version of PREDICT is a derivative  of  the  full-
       featured  Linux  version  PREDICT.   It was compiled under
       Caldera's DR-DOS 7.02 operating  system  using  the  DJGPP
       version  2.03  32-bit  protected mode software development
       environment (gcc 3.2, PDCurses 2.4).

       PREDICT is 32-bit protected mode  software,  and  as  such
       requires  a  32-bit  processor (80386 or better).  Numeric
       co-processor emulation is available for environments lack-
       ing  a  co-processor,  but  the  emulation may not provide
       results as accurate as those possible when a physical  co-
       processor is present.

       The protected mode driver (CWSDPMI.EXE) packaged with this
       software is required for proper operation of PREDICT,  and
       needs  to  be  installed  either  in  your current working
       directory, or in a subdirectory  within  your  OSs  search
       path.   (Type  "path" on your command line to inspect your
       search path.)  Users of Windows 9.x and later versions  do
       not  need  to  install  the protected mode driver included
       with this software.

FIRST TIME USE
       PREDICT tracks and predicts passes of satellites based  on
       the  geographical location of the ground station, the cur-
       rent date and time as provided by  the  computer  system's
       clock,  and  Keplerian  orbital data for the satellites of
       interest to the ground station. First time users  of  PRE-
       DICT  are  provided  default  ground  station location and
       orbital data information files. These files are managed by
       the  program,  and  are  normally  located under PREDICT's
       installation directory.  First time users must supply PRE-
       DICT with their geographical location (the same as select-
       ing option [G] from the program's  main  menu)  the  first
       time  the  program  is run. Latitude is entered in decimal
       degrees north. Latitudes south of the equator are  entered
       as  negative  values.  Longitude  is  entered  as  decimal
       degrees west.  Eastern longitudes may be entered as  nega-
       tive  values. Station altitude is entered as the number of
       meters the ground station is located above sea level. This
       parameter is not very critical.  If unsure, make a realis-
       tic guess or simply enter 0.

       Users of PREDICT  need  Keplerian  orbital  data  for  the
       satellites  they wish to track that is preferably no older
       than one month. The default orbital data supplied with the
       program  is liable to be quite old, and so must be brought
       up to date if accurate results are to  be  expected.  This
       may be accomplished by selecting option [E] from PREDICT's
       main menu and manually entering Keplerian  data  for  each
       satellite  in  the  program's  database,  or  by selecting
       option [U] and specifying a file containing recent  2-line
       Keplerian  element data sets that correspond to the satel-
       lites in the program's database.  Keplerian  orbital  data
       is   available   from  a  variety  of  sources,  including
       http://www.celestrak.com/ and http://www.amsat.org/.

PROGRAM OPERATION
       The start-up screen of PREDICT lists  the  program's  main
       functions.   Several tracking and orbital prediction modes
       are available, as well as several utilities to manage  the
       program's orbital database.

PREDICTING SATELLITE PASSES
       Orbital  predictions are useful for determining in advance
       when a satellite is expected to come  within  range  of  a
       ground station. They can also be used to look back to pre-
       vious passes to help to confirm or identify past  observa-
       tions.

       PREDICT  includes  two orbital prediction modes to predict
       any pass above a ground station (main menu option [P]), or
       list  only  those passes that might be visible to a ground
       station through optical means (main menu option [V]).   In
       either  mode,  the  user is asked to select a satellite of
       interest from a menu, and then asked to enter the date and
       time  (in  UTC)  at  which  prediction calculations should
       start.

       The current date and time may be selected  by  default  by
       entering  nothing  and  hitting  simply the ENTER key when
       prompted to enter the starting date and time.

       Otherwise, the starting date and time should be entered in
       the form:

            DDMonYY HH:MM:SS

       Entering the time is optional.  If it is omitted, midnight
       (00:00:00) is assumed.  Once  complete,  orbital  calcula-
       tions  are started and prediction information is displayed
       on the screen.

       The date and time in UTC, along with the satellite's  ele-
       vation  above  ground, azimuth heading, modulo 256 orbital
       phase, sub-satellite point latitude and  longitude,  slant
       range  between  the  ground station and the satellite, and
       the satellite's orbit number are all displayed.  If space-
       craft  attitude  parameters  (ALAT,  ALON) are included in
       PREDICT's  transponder  database  file,  then   spacecraft
       antenna  squint angles are displayed instead of orbit num-
       bers in the orbital prediction output.

       An asterisk (*) displayed to the right of the orbit number
       or  squint angle means the satellite is in sunlight at the
       date and time listed on the line. A plus symbol (+)  means
       the  satellite  is in sunlight while the ground station is
       under the cover of darkness at the time and  date  listed.
       Under  good  viewing  conditions, large satellites such as
       the International Space Station (ISS), the US Space  Shut-
       tles, and Hubble Space Telescope, and the Upper Atmosphere
       Research Satellite (UARS) are visible to the naked eye. If
       no  symbol  appears  to  the  right of each line, then the
       satellite is in the Earth's shadow at the  time  and  date
       listed,  and  is  not  receiving any illumination from the
       sun.

       Pressing the ENTER key, the 'Y'  key,  or  the  space  bar
       advances  the  orbital predictions to a screen listing the
       next available passes.  Pressing the 'L'  key  allows  the
       currently  displayed screen plus any subsequent screens to
       be logged to a text file in your  current  working  direc-
       tory.  The  name  given  to  this  file is the name of the
       satellite plus a ".txt" extension.  Any slashes or  spaces
       appearing in the satellite name are replaced by the under-
       score (_) symbol. The logging feature may  be  toggled  on
       and  off  at any time by pressing the 'L' key. Exiting the
       orbital prediction mode by pressing  'N'  or  hitting  the
       ESCape key will also close the log file. The log file will
       be appended with additional information if additional pre-
       dictions  are  conducted  for  the same satellite with the
       logging feature turned on.

       Selecting [V] from  PREDICT's  main  menu  will  permit  a
       ground  station to only predict passes for satellites that
       are potentially visible through optical means.  Since  all
       other passes are filtered out in this mode, and since some
       satellites may never arrive over  a  ground  station  when
       optical  viewing conditions are possible, the program pro-
       vides the option of breaking out of visual orbital predic-
       tion mode by pressing the [ESC]ape key as calculations are
       made. A prompt is displayed at the bottom of the screen to
       alert the user of this option.

       In either orbital prediction mode, predictions will not be
       attempted for satellites that can  never  rise  above  the
       ground station's horizon, or for satellites in geostation-
       ary orbits. If a satellite is in  range  at  the  starting
       date  and time specified, PREDICT will adjust the starting
       date back in time until the point of AOS so that the  pre-
       diction  screen  displays  the  first pass in its entirety
       from start to finish.

SINGLE SATELLITE TRACKING MODE
       In addition to predicting satellite passes, PREDICT allows
       satellites to be tracked in real-time using PREDICT's Sin-
       gle Satellite Tracking Mode (main  menu  option  [T]),  or
       simultaneously as a group of 24 using the program's Multi-
       Satellite Tracking Mode (main menu option [M]).  The posi-
       tions of the Sun and Moon are also displayed when tracking
       satellites in real-time.

       Selecting option [T] from PREDICT's main menu  places  the
       program  in  Single Satellite Tracking Mode. The user will
       be prompted to select the  satellite  of  interest,  after
       which  a screen will appear and display tracking positions
       for the satellite selected.

       In Single Satellite Tracking Mode, a wealth of information
       related to tracking a spacecraft and communicating through
       its transponder is displayed.  The current date  and  time
       is  displayed  along  with  the  satellite's sub-satellite
       point, its orbital altitude in both kilometers and statute
       miles, the slant range distance between the ground station
       and the satellite in both kilometers  and  statute  miles,
       the  current  azimuth  and  elevation  headings toward the
       satellite, the orbital velocity of the satellite  in  both
       kilometers  per hour and statute miles per hour, the foot-
       print of the satellite  in  both  kilometers  and  statute
       miles,  the modulo 256 orbital phase of the satellite, the
       eclipse depth, the spacecraft antenna  squint  angle,  and
       orbital  model in use, as well as the current orbit number
       are also displayed.  The date and time for the next AOS is
       also provided.

       Additionally,  if  the  satellite is currently in range of
       the ground station, the amount of  Doppler  shift  experi-
       enced on uplink and downlink frequencies, path loss, prop-
       agation delay, and echo times  are  also  displayed.   The
       expected time of LOS is also provided.

       Uplink  and  downlink  frequencies  are  held in PREDICT's
       transponder database file predict.db.  A default  file  is
       provided with PREDICT.

       Transponders  may  be  selected by pressing the SPACE BAR.
       The passband of the transponder may  be  tuned  in  1  kHz
       increments by pressing the < and > keys.  100 Hz tuning is
       possible using the , and . keys.  (These are simply the  <
       and > keys without the SHIFT key.)

       If  no transponder information is available, the data dis-
       played on the tracking screen is abbreviated.

       The features available in the  Single  Satellite  Tracking
       Mode  make  it possible to accurately determine the proper
       uplink frequency to yield a given downlink  frequency,  or
       vice  versa.   For  example,  if one wishes to communicate
       with a station heard on  435.85200  MHz  via  FO-29,  then
       435.85200  MHz  can  be selected via the keyboard as an RX
       frequency using the tuning keys while tracking FO-29,  and
       the  corresponding groundstation TX frequency will be dis-
       played by PREDICT.

       Obviously, an accurate system clock and up-to-date orbital
       data are required for the best tuning accuracy.

MULTI-SATELLITE TRACKING MODE
       Selecting  [M] from PREDICT's main menu places the program
       in a real-time  multi-satellite  tracking  mode.  In  this
       mode,  all  24  satellites  in  the program's database are
       tracked simultaneously along with the positions of the Sun
       and Moon. Tracking data for the satellites is displayed in
       two columns of 12 satellites each. The name, azimuth head-
       ing,  elevation,  sub-satellite point latitude (in degrees
       North) and longitude (in degrees West) positions are  pro-
       vided,  along  with  the  slant range distance between the
       satellite and the ground station (in kilometers).

       A letter displayed to the right of the slant  range  indi-
       cates  the satellite's sunlight and eclipse conditions. If
       the satellite is experiencing an eclipse period, an  N  is
       displayed.  If the satellite is in sunlight and the ground
       station is under the cover of darkness, a V  is  displayed
       to  indicate the possibility that the satellite is visible
       under the current conditions. If the satellite is in  sun-
       light  while conditions at the ground station do not allow
       the satellite to be seen, a D is displayed.  Satellites in
       range  of the ground station are displayed in BOLD letter-
       ing. The AOS dates and times for the next three satellites
       predicted  to  come into range are displayed on the bottom
       of the screen between the tracking coordinates of the  Sun
       and Moon.  Predictions are not made for satellites in geo-
       stationary orbits or for satellites so low in  inclination
       and/or altitude that they can never rise above the horizon
       of the ground station.

SOLAR ILLUMINATION PREDICTIONS
       Selecting [S] from PREDICT's main menu  will  allow  solar
       illumination  predictions  to  be made.  These predictions
       indicate how much sunlight  a  particular  satellite  will
       receive  in  a  24 hour period.  This information is espe-
       cially valuable  to  spacecraft  designers  and  satellite
       groundstation  controllers  who  must  monitor  spacecraft
       power budgets or thermal conditions on-board their  space-
       craft due to sunlight and eclipse periods.  It can even be
       used to predict the optimum times for astronauts  to  per-
       form  extra-vehicular activities in space. Solar illumina-
       tion predictions may be logged to a file in the same  man-
       ner  that  orbital  predictions may be logged (by pressing
       L).

COMMAND LINE ARGUMENTS
       By default, PREDICT  reads  ground  station  location  and
       orbital  data  information from a pair of files located in
       the current working directory.   Ground  station  location
       information  is  held  in  a file named predict.qth, while
       orbital data information for 24 satellites is  held  in  a
       file  named predict.tle.  If orbital data for more than 24
       satellites exists in predict.tle, then only the  first  24
       satellites are read by PREDICT.

       If  we  wish  to  run  PREDICT  using  data from alternate
       sources instead of these default files, the names of  such
       files  may  be  passed to PREDICT on the command line when
       the program is started. For example, if we  wish  to  read
       the  TLE  file  visual.tle  and  the  QTH file holiday.qth
       rather than the default files, we could start PREDICT  and
       pass  the names of these alternate files to the program in
       the following manner:

            predict -t visual.tle -q holiday.qth

       or

            predict -q holiday.qth -t visual.tle

       If the files specified are  not  located  in  the  current
       working  directory,  then their relative or absolute paths
       should also be specified along with their  names  (predict
       -t c:\keps\visual.tle).

       It  is  also  possible  to specify only one alternate file
       while using the default for the other. For example,

            predict -t visual.tle

       reads QTH information from the default  predict.qth  file,
       and TLE information from visual.tle, while

            predict -q bobs.qth

       reads  QTH  information  from bobs.qth and TLE information
       from the default predict.tle location.

QUIET ORBITAL DATABASE UPDATES
       It is also possible to update PREDICT's satellite  orbital
       database  using  another  command line option that updates
       the database from a NASA two-line element data  set.  PRE-
       DICT then quietly exits without displaying anything to the
       screen, thereby eliminating the need for entering the pro-
       gram  and  selecting  the  appropriate  menu options. This
       option is invoked using the -u command line switch as fol-
       lows:

            predict -u orbs248.tle

       This  example  updates  PREDICT's default orbital database
       with the Keplerian elements found in the file orbs248.tle.
       PREDICT may be updated from a list of files as well:

            predict -u amateur.tle visual.tle weather.tle

       If an alternate datafile requires updating, it may also be
       specified on the command line using the -t switch as  fol-
       lows:

            predict -t oscar.tle -u amateur.tle

       This  example  updates the oscar.tle orbital database with
       the two-line element data contained in amateur.tle.

       These options permit the  automatic  update  of  PREDICT's
       orbital  data  files using Keplerian orbital data obtained
       through automatic means  such  as  FTP,  HTTP,  or  pacsat
       satellite download.

AUTOMATIC ANTENNA TRACKING
       PREDICT  is  compatible  with  serial port antenna rotator
       interfaces conforming to the EasyComm 2 protocol standard.
       This includes the PIC/TRACK interface developed by Vicenzo
       Mezzalira,  IW3FOL   <http://digilander.iol.it/iw3fol/pic-
       track.html>,  TAPR's EasyTrak Jr.  (currently under devel-
       opment), and Suding Associates  Incorporated's  Dish  Con-
       trollers         <http://www.ultimatecharger.com/Dish_Con-
       trollers.html>.  Using any of these  hardware  interfaces,
       PREDICT  can  automatically  control the position of AZ/EL
       antenna rotators, and  keep  antennas  accurately  pointed
       toward  a  satellite  being tracked by PREDICT.  In opera-
       tion, tracking data from PREDICT is directed to the speci-
       fied  serial  port  using the -a command line option.  For
       example:

            predict -a com1

       will send AZ/EL tracking data to  the  first  serial  port
       when  the  program  is  tracking a satellite in the Single
       Satellite Tracking Mode.  The data sent to the serial port
       is  of  the  form:  AZ241.0 EL26.0 using 9600 baud, 8-data
       bits, 1-stop bit, no parity, and no handshaking.  Data  is
       sent to the interface if the azimuth or elevation headings
       change by one degree or more.   For  interfaces  requiring
       keepalive  updates  at  least  once per second whether the
       AZ/EL headings have changed or not (such as  the  ones  by
       SAI), the -a1 option may be used:

            predict -a1 com1

       (Note:  The  DOS  version  of  PREDICT lacks a serial port
       driver that more likely than not will prevent PREDICT from
       successfully  sending  data  to  the  serial port tracking
       interfaces described here.)

ADDITIONAL OPTIONS
       The -f command-line option, when followed by  a  satellite
       name  or object number and starting date/time, allows PRE-
       DICT to respond  with  satellite  positional  information.
       This  feature  allows  PREDICT  to be invoked within other
       applications that need to  determine  the  location  of  a
       satellite at a particular point in time, such as the loca-
       tion of where a CCD camera image was  taken  by  a  Pacsat
       satellite based on its timestamp.

       The  information  produced  includes the date/time in Unix
       format (the number of seconds since midnight UTC  on  Jan-
       uary 1, 1970), the date/time in ASCII (UTC), the elevation
       of the satellite in degrees, the azimuth  heading  of  the
       satellite,  the  orbital  phase (modulo 256), the latitude
       (N) and longitude (W)  of  the  satellite's  sub-satellite
       point at the time specified, the slant range to the satel-
       lite in kilometers with respect to  the  ground  station's
       location,  the orbit number, and the spacecraft's sunlight
       visibility information.

       The date/time must be specified in Unix format (number  of
       seconds  since  midnight  UTC  on January 1, 1970).  If no
       starting  or  ending  time  is  specified,   the   current
       date/time  is  assumed and a single line of output is pro-
       duced.  If a starting and ending  time  are  specified,  a
       list  of  coordinates  beginning at the starting time/date
       and ending with the ending time/date will be  returned  by
       the program with a one second resolution.  If the letter m
       is  appended  to  the  ending  time/date,  then  the  data
       returned by the program will have a one minute resolution.
       The -o option allows the program to write  the  calculated
       data  to  an  output  file rather than directing it to the
       standard output device if desired.

       The proper syntax for this option is as follows:

            predict -f ISS 977446390 977446400 -o datafile

       A list of coordinates starting at  the  current  date/time
       and ending 10 seconds later may be produced by the follow-
       ing command:

            predict -f ISS +10

       If a list of coordinates specifying the  position  of  the
       satellite every minute for the next 10 minutes is desired,
       the following command may be used:

            predict -f ISS +10m

       If a satellite name contains spaces, then the entire  name
       must be enclosed by "quotes".

       The -p option allows orbital predictions for a single pass
       to be generated by  PREDICT  via  the  command-line.   For
       example:

            predict -p OSCAR-11 1003536767

       starts  predictions  for  the OSCAR-11 satellite at a Unix
       time of 1003536767 (Sat 20Oct01  00:12:47  UTC).   If  the
       starting  date/time  is  omitted, the current date/time is
       used.  If a pass is already in progress  at  the  starting
       date/time specified, orbital predictions are moved back to
       the beginning of AOS of the current pass, and data for the
       entire pass from AOS to LOS is provided.

       When  either  the  -f or -p options are used, PREDICT pro-
       duces an output consisting of the date/time in  Unix  for-
       mat,  the  date  and time in ASCII (UTC), the elevation of
       the satellite in degrees, the azimuth of the satellite  in
       degrees,  the orbital phase (modulo 256), the latitude (N)
       and longitude (W) of the satellite's sub-satellite  point,
       the  slant  range  to  the  satellite (in kilometers), the
       orbit number, and  the  spacecraft's  sunlight  visibility
       information.  For example:

       1003611710  Sat  20Oct01 21:01:50   11    6  164   51   72
       1389  16669 *

       The output isn't annotated, but then again, it's meant  to
       be read by other software.

ADDING SATELLITES
       One  of  the most frequently asked questions is how satel-
       lites in PREDICT's orbital database may  be  added,  modi-
       fied,  or  replaced.   As  it turns out, there are several
       ways in which this can be done.  Probably the  easiest  is
       to  manually  edit  your  predict.tle file, and replace an
       existing satellite's entry with 2-line Keplerian data  for
       the  new  satellite.   If  this method is chosen, however,
       just make sure to include ONLY  the  two  line  data,  and
       nothing else.

       Another  way is to is select the Keyboard Edit option from
       the program's Main Menu, select a satellite  you  wish  to
       replace.   Edit  the name and object number (replacing the
       old information  with  the  new  information).   Just  hit
       ENTER,  and accept all the other orbital parameters shown.
       Get back to PREDICT's Main Menu.  Select Auto Update,  and
       then enter the filename containing the 2-line element data
       for your favorite new satellite.  The new  satellite  data
       should  be  detected  by PREDICT, and the orbital data for
       the old satellite will be overwritten by the new data.

GLOSSARY OF TERMS
       The following terms are  frequently  used  in  association
       with satellite communications and space technology:

AOS:
       Acquisition of Signal - the time at which a ground station
       first acquires radio signals  from  a  satellite.  PREDICT
       defines  AOS  as the time when the satellite being tracked
       comes within  +/-  0.03  degrees  of  the  local  horizon,
       although  it may have to rise higher than this before sig-
       nals are first heard.

Apogee:
       Point in a satellite's orbit when the satellite is at  its
       farthest distance from the earth's surface.

Anomalistic Period:
       A  satellite orbital parameter specifying the time between
       successive perigees.

Ascending Node:
       Point in a satellite's orbit when its sub-satellite  point
       crosses the equator moving south to north.

Azimuth:
       The  compass direction measured clockwise from true north.
       North = 0 degrees, East = 90 degrees, South = 180 degrees,
       and West = 270 degrees.

Descending Node:
       Point  in a satellite's orbit when its sub-satellite point
       crosses the equator moving north to south.

Doppler Shift:
       The motion of a satellite in its orbit around  the  earth,
       and  in  many  cases  the  rotational  motion of the earth
       itself, causes radio signals generated by satellites to be
       received  on  Earth at frequencies slightly different than
       those upon which they were transmitted. PREDICT calculates
       what  effect  these  motions have upon radio communication
       links with satellites when they are within  range  of  the
       groundstation.

Elevation:
       The  angle  between  the local horizon and the position of
       the satellite. A satellite that appears directly  above  a
       particular  location is said to be located at an elevation
       of 90 degrees. A satellite located on  the  horizon  of  a
       particular  location is said to be located at an elevation
       of 0 degrees.  A satellite with an elevation of less  than
       zero is positioned below the local horizon, and radio com-
       munication with a satellite in such a position is not pos-
       sible under normal circumstances.

Footprint:
       Diameter  of the Earth's surface visible from a satellite.
       The higher the satellite's orbital altitude,  the  greater
       the  footprint,  and  the wider the satellite's communica-
       tions coverage.

LOS:
       Loss of Signal - the time at which a ground station  loses
       radio contact with a satellite. PREDICT defines LOS as the
       time when the satellite being  tracked  comes  within  +/-
       0.03 degrees of the local horizon.

Orbital Phase:
       An  orbital  "clock"  that describes a satellite's orbital
       position with respect to perigee.  Orbital  Phase  may  be
       modulo 256, or modulo 360, and is sometimes referred to as
       mean anomaly when speaking of amateur radio satellites  in
       elliptical   orbits,  such  as  the  Phase  3  satellites.
       Orbital phase is zero at perigee.

Path Loss:
       The apparent attenuation a radio signal  undergoes  as  it
       travels  a  given distance. This attenuation is the result
       of the dispersion radio waves experience as they propagate
       between  transmitter and receiver using antennas of finite
       gain. Free space path  loss  is  technically  an  oxymoron
       since free space is loss free.

Perigee:
       Point  in a satellite's orbit when the satellite is at its
       closest distance to the earth's surface.

Nodal Period:
       A satellite orbital parameter specifying the time  between
       successive ascending nodes.

Slant Range:
       The  straight line distance between the ground station and
       the satellite at a given time.

Sub-Satellite Point:
       The latitude and longitude specifying the location on  the
       Earth that is directly below the satellite.
