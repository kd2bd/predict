Building and Installating "earthtrack"
======================================

To build "earthtrack", simply invoke the "build" script as follows:

	./build

You do not need to be root to build "earthtrack".

To run "earthtrack" globally on a multiuser system, it must be
installed in a publically accessible directory within the $PATH
of your users.  To so this, simply invoke the "install" script
from this directory as follows:

	./install

This must be done as root.

Once the program has been installed, it may be modified and rebuilt
at any time by invoking the "build" script once again.  It is not
necessary to re-run "install" script or su to root every time
the program is modified.  HOWEVER, you may wish to protect
the installation directory used by this program to prevent
unauthorized modification and compilation of the source
code when installed on a multiuser system.

If you are root, and are installing "earthtrack" for the first time,
you may build and install this application with just one command by
involking the "install" script as follows:

	./install

See the README file for more information on the use and capabilities
of this program.


Happy Tracking!
